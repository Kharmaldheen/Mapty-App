# About The Mapty App

This app was built with the HTML, CSS, JS And the Leaflet library. This is my first app built with OOP. I practised my javascript skills with the same. In this app, the user can record his/her running and cycling record over time. Once the user selects a position on a map, a form will pop out where the user can fill the type of exercise (running or cycling), the distance in KM, duration, cadence(running) and elevation gain (cycling). Also, implemented local storage so the data are saved and rendered upon page referesh.

Happy Checking!!!
